description: "Big Suze is an illustrator and animator based in Glasgow. As an image-maker Suzie explores themes of gender, censorship and the provocative within her practice. For the last few years this has resulted in focussing on the phallus, and how the male gaze informs reactions to her work. Alongside her freelance illustration practice, Suzie works at Print Clan, an open-access textile screen printing studio in Glasgow. She is particularly interested in facilitating arts access for disadvantaged communities and groups. Suzie is always open to commissions and collaborations and she also offers an affordable screen printing service for artists & illustrators wanting small editions."
