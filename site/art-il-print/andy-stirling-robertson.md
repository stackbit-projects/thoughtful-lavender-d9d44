description: "Andy's art explores to the difference between maps and territory, exploring the dichotomy of space and place. The gicl√©e prints use high quality, fade-resistant, pigment-based inks which result in an archival lifespan of up to 200 years. With a clear focus on sustainability, all prints are only printed after ordering by a carbon neutral printing service. Andy also pledges to plant a tree for every print sold, with the goal of printing 500 trees by 2025. Prints can be purchased via Andy's website."
