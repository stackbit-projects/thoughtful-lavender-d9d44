description: "‘Kairogen’ is a word created by the artist Kirsten Bradley Henderson, which translates as ‘the perfect time to create is now’. She is an audiovisual artist  and her visual art style has a key focus of intuitive, abstract expression. Kariogen looks to a fluid, meditative process where work flows with both sound and art in its various forms."
