description: "Kitty's distinctive compositions are inspired by the ordinary. Her creations look at the unnoticed through a lens, highlighting the beauty and detail of forms we usually take for granted. Since graduating in 2018 Kitty has been creating organic, free-flowing designs for wall art and textiles in Glasgow's East End."
