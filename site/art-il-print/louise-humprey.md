description: "Louise's passion lies in the fine art discipline of the cyanotype print. Cyanotype printing also known as the Blueprint process, is a photographic print process dating back to the Victorian era. The process allows the artist to create beautiful individual prussian blue and white prints, using selectively sourced items & objects as subject matter. Each of Louise's prints are individually hand-made. Often working with nature to reflect her influences from the complex structures within the natural environment. This makes each cyanotype print completely bespoke and completely unique. Available for purchase or private commission via Instagram and Etsy."
